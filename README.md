## 🩺 Project Overview  

**BreastCancer Precision Finder (BC-PF)** is a **patient-centered web platform** that democratizes access to clinical trials through **AI-powered trial matching** and a **simplified, intuitive interface**.  

The platform empowers breast cancer patients to:
- Upload their **pathology reports** or manually enter **biomarker data** (ER/PR/HER2, genomic mutations).  
- Automatically receive **personalized matches** to relevant **clinical trials** based on their molecular subtype, demographics, and treatment history.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals  

Deliver a **functional patient-facing prototype** that:  

1. **Accepts patient input**  
   - Allows uploading of pathology reports (PDF/text).  
   - Enables manual entry of key biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2, mutation info).  

2. **Extracts key biomarkers**  
   - Uses text analysis to identify and parse ER/PR/HER2 status.  

3. **Classifies patient subtype**  
   - Determines breast cancer subtype (e.g., HER2+, TNBC, Luminal A/B).  

4. **Fetches live clinical trial data**  
   - Integrates with **ClinicalTrials.gov API** to retrieve current trials.  

5. **Performs intelligent matching**  
   - Applies rule-based logic to match by subtype, age, location, and gender.  

6. **Displays results transparently**  
   - Presents matched trials with **confidence scores** and **clear explanations** of why each trial was selected.

## 💡 Vision  

BC-PF aims to **bridge the gap between patients and clinical research** — providing clarity, empowerment, and timely opportunities for individuals navigating complex treatment landscapes.
